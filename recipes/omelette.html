        <h3> Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li> 1 whole yellow onion, peeled and chopped into ¼’’ chunks</li>
            <li> 6-7 potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li> 5-6 large eggs</li>
            <li> Salt to taste</li>
            <li> 3 cups olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> Cut the potatoes into ⅛ thick slices and add them to a bowl.</li>
            <li> Add the chopped onions to the same bowl and add a dash of salt to season; toss well to mix.</li>
            <li> Heat olive oil in a large frying pan, over moderately high flame and spread the onion-potato mixture evenly across the skillet.</li>
            <li> Lower the heat if necessary to prevent the potatoes from burning.</li>
            <li> Cook the veggies until they are cooked through; test the doneness of the potatoes by poking them with a fork or skewer.</li>
            <li> Drain out the veggies with a slotted spoon and transfer them to a bowl lined with paper towel to soak away extra oil.</li>
            <li> Crack the eggs into a large bowl and whisk them thoroughly with a fork until they turn into a pale yellowsh mixture without any white strands.</li>
            <li> Add the fried onion-potato mixture to the whisked eggs and stir them well together until the former are distributed evenly throughout the beaten eggs.</li>
            <li> Drizzle 2 tbsp olive oil on a smaller frying pan and heat it over moderate flame but don't let it smoke to stop the omelette from burning.</li>
            <li> Give another stir to the egg-veggie mixture and pour it into the pan.</li>
            <li> Tilt the pan slightly to spread it evenly throughout the pan and cook it until it is set around the sides.</li>
            <li> Lift one of its side carefully with a spatula to check the doneness of the omelette; it should be browned slightly while the interiors should e slightly runny.</li>
            <li> Place a flat plate on top of the frying pan and flip it over to transfer the omelette to the plate.</li>
            <li> Return the pan to heat and pour enough oil in it so that it stands about 1" from the base.</li>
            <li> Heat it for about half a minute and return the omelette back to the pan.</li>
            <li> Cook it for about 5 minutes and remove from heat.</li>
            <li> Let it rest for a couple of minutes and then slide the omelette to a serving plate.</li>
            <li> Serve it as a main course or slice it into 6-8 squares to turn it into an appetizer.</li>
        </ol>
