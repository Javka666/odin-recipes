        <h2>Description </h2>
        <p> Lasagna is such a  great pasta dish.  This recipe, adapated from the Flickr link above  is a combo of one of the standard lasagna box recipes and f improvisation for the sauce by using jarred sauce instead of making it from scratch.  This uses oven-ready, no cook lasagna noodles, which use the moisture from the sauce to cook the pasta. If you make a real meaty sauce, you might want to use precooked lasagna noodles instead.</p>
